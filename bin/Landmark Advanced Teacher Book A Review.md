However, the book is not to be confused with another course with a similar name: The Landmark Advanced Course, which is a personal development program offered by Landmark Worldwide, a company that provides training and coaching services. The Landmark Advanced Course is designed to help participants create a future of their own design, not limited by the past, and to develop new ways of being and acting that lead to more possibilities and fulfillment. The Landmark Advanced Course is not related to the Landmark Advanced Teacher Book or the Landmark Advanced coursebook for English language learners.
